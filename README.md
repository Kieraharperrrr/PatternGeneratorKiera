# PatternGeneratorKiera

This code is a pattern generator. It allows users to create their own unique pattern but moving their mouse around the screen. They will see that moving the mouse will produce a line of different coloured dots. These colours are randomly generated, so no two patterens will look the same. Any patteren created, can be easily cleared by clicking the mouse.
